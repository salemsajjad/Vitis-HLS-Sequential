# Clock Divider IP core desigend with Vitis HLS


This IP core has an input and a output.

In the test bench I divided the clock by 20 and he generated clock has 50% duty cycle.

After RTL/C Co simulation we can see this waveform:

I've used Digilent #PYNQ #Z1 and tested these projects on this board.

Note: The Xilinx Vivado and Vitis tools that I used in these projects is the #2020.2 vesrion. 

--> Thanks to Professor Mohammad Hosseinabady for his useful HLS course.
