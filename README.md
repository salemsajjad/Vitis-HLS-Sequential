# Vitis HLS Sequential Projects

This repository contains my combinational Vitis HLS codes, Vivado projects and bitstream files.

I've used Digilent #PYNQ #Z1 and tested these projects on this board.

Note: The Xilinx Vivado and Vitis tools that I used in these projects is the #2020.2 vesrion.

-> Thanks to Professor Mohammad Hosseinabady for his useful HLS course.
