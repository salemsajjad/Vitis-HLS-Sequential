# First Exmaple of using D flip flop and registers in Vitis HLS

In this example I've design a simple register containing three D flip flops.

The picture shows the HLS shift register module containing one binary input and three binary outputs:

And here is the waveform generation from the Co-Simulation:

I've used Digilent #PYNQ #Z1 and tested these projects on this board.

Note: The Xilinx Vivado and Vitis tools that I used in these projects is the #2020.2 vesrion.
