# First Exmaple of using D flip flop and registers in Vitis HLS

In this example I've design a simple register containing three D flip flops.

As the picture is shown bellow the module has one binary input and three binary outputs.

I've used Digilent #PYNQ #Z1 and tested these projects on this board.

Note: The Xilinx Vivado and Vitis tools that I used in these projects is the #2020.2 vesrion.
