# Here is the pulse generator IP core desigend with Vitis HLS


the picture shows a module has one input pulse and a clock. Then it can receive a wide pulse and genarate a one-cycle pulse in the output.

After RTL/C Co simulation we can see this waveform:

I've used Digilent #PYNQ #Z1 and tested these projects on this board.

Note: The Xilinx Vivado and Vitis tools that I used in these projects is the #2020.2 vesrion. 

--> Thanks to Professor Mohammad Hosseinabady for his useful HLS course.
